# Exam Tips

## VPC Intro

- Think of a VPC as a logical data center in AWS
- Consists of IGW(or Virtual Private Gateways), route tables, network access control lists (NACL), subnets, security groups
- 1 subnet = 1 AZ
- Security groups are Statful; NACLs are Stateless
  - Must open both inbound and outbound ports for NACLs
- NO TRANSITIVE PEERING!!
- Allowed 5 VPC's in each AWS Region by default

## Flow Logs

- You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account.
- Cannot tag a flow log
- After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration; for example, you cant associate a differenct IAM role with the flow log

**Not all IP traffic is monitored**

- Traffic generated by instances when they contact the Amazon DNS server. If you use your own DNS server, then all traffic to the DNS server is logged.
- Traffic generated by a Windows instance for Amazon Windows license activation.
- Traffic to and from 169.254.169.254 for instance metadata
- DHCP traffic
- Traffic to the reserved IP address for the default VPC router

## NAT vs Bastion

- A NAT is used to provide internet traffic to EC2 instances in private subnets
- A Bastion is used to securely administer EC2 instances using SSH or RDP

`bastion host`  ->   `private server`
