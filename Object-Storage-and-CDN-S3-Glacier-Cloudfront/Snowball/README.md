# Snowballs

## What are the different types of Snowballs available?

### Snowball

Petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS.

Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns.

Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure and can be as little as 1/5 the cost of high-speed internet. 

80TB Snowballs are available in all regions. Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistent enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data.

Once the data transfer job has been proccessed and verified, AWS performs a software erase of the Snowball appliance

### Snowball Edge

Snowball Edge is a 100TB data transfer device with on-board storage and compute capabilities. You can use Snowball Edge to move large amounts of data into and out of AWS, as a temporary  storage tier for large datasets, or to support local workloads in remote or offline locations.

Snowball Edge connects to your existing applications and infrastructure using standard storage interfaces, streamlining the data transfer process and minimizing setup and intergration.

Snowball Edge can cluster together to form a local storage tier and process your data on-premises, helping ensure your applications continue to run even when they are not able to access the cloud.

### Snowmobile

Snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move EXTREMELY large amounts of data to AWS.

You can transfer up to 100PB per Snowmobile, a 45ft long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-truck.
